# Simple Maven Project with Java Application

This repository contains a simple Maven-based Java project. It demonstrates the basic structure of a Java application managed by Maven.

## Project Structure

The project structure typically follows the standard Maven directory layout:

- `src/main/java`: Contains the Java source files.
- `src/test/java`: Contains the test source files.
- `pom.xml`: The Project Object Model (POM) file that configures the project.
